This is a final project of momentum from Nomadcoder.
I'm using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript here.

Future plan:
Weather: if statement for each weather icon.
Background: Better image and color-theme based on which day.
Todo: location? can you move up and down? based on the importance, can you show it right bottom of the welcome message?
Todo form: less ugly.
Todo list: less ugly.
Quotes: author at the bottom. better location?
Time: today's date?
